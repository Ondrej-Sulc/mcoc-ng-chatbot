            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">3. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>
              You are solely responsible for the content you submit to the Service. By uploading a video, you affirm that:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside pl-4 space-y-1">
              <li>You have the necessary rights and permissions to the content you are uploading.</li>
              <li>The content does not infringe on the copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights of any third party.</li>
              <li>The content adheres to the terms of service of both Discord and YouTube.</li>
              <li>You will not submit content that is hateful, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to remove any content and/or suspend user access to the upload feature for violations of these terms.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">4. Video Uploads and YouTube</h2>
            <p>
              The Service uses the YouTube Data API to upload videos to a designated YouTube channel. By using the video upload feature, you agree to be bound by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-primary hover:underline">YouTube Terms of Service</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are not responsible for any issues, content strikes, or account actions taken by YouTube. Videos are uploaded as "unlisted" by default unless you specify otherwise, meaning they are not publicly searchable on YouTube but are accessible via a direct link.
            </p>
