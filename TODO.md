# TODO

- Implement a more robust management system for AQ, to schedule in advance.
- Move the sheet ID and other sensitive data to the database for the `/aw` command.
- Add more profile management features to the `/profile` command.
- remove custom cron stuff from `/schedule` and make it more user friendly to use.
